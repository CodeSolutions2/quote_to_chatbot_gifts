"There's no single answer to the question \"What is the distance of the shallowest sea?\" Here's why:\n\n* **\"Shallow\" is relative.** What's considered shallow in one context might be deep in another.\n* **Seas have varying depths.** Even within a single sea, the depth can change dramatically.\n\n**Here are some examples to illustrate:**\n\n* **The shallowest part of the Baltic Sea** is around 50 meters deep.\n* **The shallowest part of the Caribbean Sea** is about 20 meters deep.\n* **The shallowest part of the North Sea** is about 15 meters deep.\n\n**To answer your question, you would need to specify:**\n\n* **Which sea are you asking about?**\n* **What do you consider \"shallow\"?** \n\nLet me know if you have a specific sea in mind, and I can help you find the shallowest point. \n"
