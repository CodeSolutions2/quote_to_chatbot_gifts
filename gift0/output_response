            "text": "It's impossible to say definitively what the \"shallowest sea\" is, as there are many factors to consider.  Here's why:\n\n* **What defines a sea?**  There's no strict scientific definition for what constitutes a \"sea\" versus a \"lake\" or a \"bay\". Some bodies of water called \"seas\" are connected to larger oceans, others are almost entirely enclosed.\n* **What does \"shallowest\" mean?** Do we mean the shallowest average depth, the shallowest point, or the shallowest depth of the seafloor at its edge?\n* **Varying depths:** Even within a single \"sea\", the depth can vary greatly.\n\nHowever, we can look at some contenders for the title of \"shallowest sea\":\n\n* **The Sea of Azov:**  This sea in the Black Sea basin is very shallow, with an average depth of only 7 meters (23 feet). \n* **The Baltic Sea:**  This sea in northern Europe has an average depth of 55 meters (180 feet), but its shallowest parts are significantly less than that.\n* **The Gulf of Mexico:**  This large gulf has an average depth of 1,500 meters (4,900 feet) but its shallowest parts near the coast are very shallow.\n\n**Ultimately, the \"shallowest sea\" depends on how you define \"sea\" and \"shallowest\".** \n"
