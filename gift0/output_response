"There's no single answer to \"the shallowest sea\" because it depends on what you define as a \"sea.\" \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Seas are connected to oceans:** Most seas are technically part of the larger ocean, just with smaller, more enclosed areas. \n* **Depth varies within seas:** Even a single sea can have dramatically different depths in different areas. \n\nFor example:\n\n* **The Baltic Sea:** This sea is considered relatively shallow, with an average depth of 55 meters (180 ft). However, it has deeper areas. \n* **The Black Sea:** Has an average depth of 1,240 meters (4,070 ft), but it also has shallower parts.\n\n**To answer your question more accurately, you need to specify what you mean by \"shallowest sea.\"**\n\n* **Shallowest average depth:** In this case, the Baltic Sea might be considered the shallowest.\n* **Shallowest point:** You'd need to find the specific location within a sea that has the least depth. \n\nLet me know if you have a specific sea in mind, and I can help you find its shallowest point! \n"
