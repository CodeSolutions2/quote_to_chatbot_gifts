"There's no single answer to the question of the \"shallowest sea\" because it depends on how you define \"sea.\" \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Different definitions of \"sea\":** The term \"sea\" can refer to a large body of saltwater that's:\n README.md gift0 gift1 library_to_run_GitHub_Actions.js **Part of an ocean:** Like the North Sea or the Mediterranean Sea.\n README.md gift0 gift1 library_to_run_GitHub_Actions.js **A completely enclosed body of water:** Like the Caspian Sea or the Dead Sea.\n README.md gift0 gift1 library_to_run_GitHub_Actions.js **A large lake:** Some people refer to very large lakes like the Great Lakes in North America as \"seas.\"\n\n* **Varying depths:** Even within the same body of water, the depth can vary significantly. The shallowest point of a sea could be near the shore, while the deepest point might be in the middle.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* **The North Sea:** Has an average depth of around 90 meters, but its shallowest point is likely just a few meters deep near the coast.\n* **The Caspian Sea:** Is the largest enclosed body of water, but has an average depth of 200 meters, with shallow areas along the shoreline.\n* **The Dead Sea:** Is known for its high salt content and low elevation. Its deepest point is about 304 meters, but the shallowest areas could be significantly shallower.\n\n**So, there is no single \"shallowest sea.\"** The shallowest point of any given sea would depend on the specific location and its proximity to the shore. \n"
