"There's no definitive answer to the question of the \"shortest mountain.\" Here's why:\n\n* **Defining a mountain:** There's no universally agreed-upon definition of what constitutes a mountain. Some definitions use elevation above sea level, others focus on prominence (how much a peak rises above its surrounding terrain), and some consider geological features.\n* **Variety of terrain:** The world is full of hills, plateaus, and low-lying formations that could be considered mountains depending on the definition used.\n\n**However, we can look at some examples of relatively low-elevation landforms that might be considered mountains:**\n\n* **Mount Wycheproof, Australia:** At just 148 meters (485 feet) above sea level, it's often considered the shortest mountain. However, its prominence is very low.\n* **Mount Pico de Orizaba, Mexico:** This volcanic peak, though significantly higher than Mount Wycheproof, is often referred to as a \"mountain\" even though it's part of a much larger volcanic complex.\n\nUltimately, determining the \"shortest mountain\" is subjective and depends on the specific criteria used. \n"
