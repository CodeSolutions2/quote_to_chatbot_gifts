"There's no single answer to this question because it depends on how you define \"mountain.\" \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **There's no official definition of a mountain:** Some people use a minimum height requirement (like 1,000 feet), while others focus on the presence of a peak or a significant change in elevation.\n* **\"Shortest\" is relative:** The shortest mountain in the world would be determined based on a specific criteria for what qualifies as a mountain. \n\n**Here are some possibilities:**\n\n* **Mount Wycheproof, Australia:** This hill is only 486 feet tall and is considered the smallest named mountain in the world by some.\n* **Other hills and mountains:** There are likely many smaller hills and mountains around the world, but they may not have official names or be recognized as mountains due to their size.\n\nUltimately, the answer to \"what is the shortest mountain\" is subjective and depends on your definition of a mountain. \n"
