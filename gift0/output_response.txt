"It's impossible to give a single distance for the \"shallowest sea\" because it depends on how you define \"shallowest.\" \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Depth varies greatly within a sea:** Seas are not uniform in depth. Some areas are very shallow, while others are much deeper. \n* **\"Sea\" can be interpreted differently:** The term \"sea\" can refer to a large body of salt water connected to an ocean, or a smaller, isolated body of water.\n\n**For example:**\n\n* **The shallowest part of the Baltic Sea** is only about **5 meters deep** in some areas. \n* **The shallowest part of the Mediterranean Sea** is around **20 meters deep**. \n* **The shallowest part of the North Sea** is about **10 meters deep**.\n\nTo answer your question more precisely, you'd need to specify which sea you're interested in. \n"
