"This is a tricky question! There isn't a universally agreed upon definition of what constitutes a \"mountain\". \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Different organizations have different criteria:** Some define a mountain as needing a certain elevation gain, others focus on a specific shape or geological formation.\n* **Height is relative:** A peak might be considered a mountain in one context, but just a hill in another. \n\n**That being said, here are a couple of possibilities for the \"shortest mountain\":**\n\n* **Mount Wycheproof, Australia:** This hill is officially recognized as a mountain by the Australian government, and it's only **487 feet (148 meters)** tall. \n* **Other low-elevation peaks:** Many mountains around the world are only a few hundred feet tall. There's no official record of the *absolute* shortest mountain.\n\n**Ultimately, the answer depends on how you define \"mountain\"!** \n"
