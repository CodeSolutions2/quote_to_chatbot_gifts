"That depends on what you mean by \"distance\"! \n\n* **If you're asking about the height of the tallest mountain:** That would be Mount Everest, which is 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet) tall.\n* **If you're asking about the distance from the base to the summit of the tallest mountain:** This varies depending on which side you measure from. The distance from the South Col to the summit of Mount Everest is about 3.7 miles (6 kilometers).\n\nPlease clarify your question, and I'll be happy to give you a more specific answer. \n"
