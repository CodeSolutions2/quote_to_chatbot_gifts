"This question is a bit tricky! There isn't a universally agreed-upon definition of what constitutes a \"mountain.\" \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Elevation:** Some definitions require a mountain to be a certain height above sea level. But what's that minimum height? \n* **Prominence:** Others focus on a mountain's prominence, meaning how much higher it is than the surrounding terrain.\n* **Geological Formation:** The definition could also involve the way a mountain formed.\n\n**So, what might be considered the shortest mountain?**\n\n* **A hill:** If we don't set a height requirement, a very small hill could technically be considered a mountain. \n* **A geological rise:** There might be very small, low-lying rises in the ground that could be considered mountains based on their geological formation.\n\n**To find a definitive answer, you'd need a very specific definition of what constitutes a \"mountain.\"** \n"
