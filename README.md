# quote_to_chatbot_gifts

Log quotes or expressions from friends and family and give a text-2-chatbot to them as a gift. Help friends and family learn to take self-responsibility, self-respect, and life planning/control of their life by giving them a chatbot to help them monitor and evaluate their life progress using different AI models (ie: OpenAI, Gemini, etc). A library that I created on jsdelivr/npm [library_to_run_GitHub_Actions.js](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/library_to_run_github_actions) is used to encrypt model tokens and launch repository processes. 

## Best working version 
[Working version using the Google Gemini model] https://codesolutions2.github.io/quote_to_chatbot_gifts/gift0/index7.html

## In progress
  - Make the UI more explainatory
  - Add user credential inputs such as storage of [keys, personal text] in Google Storage
  - Add two more AI professional models (OpenAI, etc)
