# quote_to_chatbot_gifts

Log quotes or expressions from friends and family and give a text-2-chatbot to them as a gift. Help friends and family learn to take self-responsibility, self-respect, and life planning/control of their life by giving them a chatbot to help them monitor and evaluate their life progress using different AI models (ie: OpenAI, Gemini, etc).

## Instructions for how to use Quote-to-chatbot gifts
Welcome to this "Walk-up-app" where your data is used to make agents similar to the quotes/text content you enter. Please put the following information into the webapp: [0] Enter your Google Gemini or OpenAI KEY, [1] Enter quotes/text content in the textarea that you wish to use to train the chatbot. For example, quotes of someone will train the chatbot to have the persona of someone who would say the quotes. [2] Click on the "Chatbot" sidebar and start talking with your "Quote programmed chatbot"!

For instance, if you need help writing a passage, input some text that you already wrote and then ask the chatbot to write a passage. The chatbot will use your text as a guide to write the passage, as if you had written it. As another example, if you need to solve a problem write text about problems and solutions that you used to solve the problems; ask the chatbot to give you solutions to your new problem. The chatbot will use your text as a guide to answer how to solve your new problem.
